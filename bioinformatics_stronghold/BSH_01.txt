Problem

A string is simply an ordered collection of symbols selected from some alphabet and formed into a word; the length of a string is the number of symbols that it contains.

An example of a length 21 DNA string (whose alphabet contains the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T') is "ATGCTTCAGAAAGGTCTTACG."

Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1000 nt.

Return: Four integers (separated by spaces) counting the respective number of times that the symbols 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' occur in s.

ANSWER :
fname = raw_input('Enter the file name: ')
fhand = open(fname,'r')

seq = dict()
seq['A'] = 0
seq['C'] = 0
seq['G'] = 0
seq['T'] = 0

with open(fname,'r') as f:
	inputseq = f.read()
print(inputseq)

for c in inputseq:
    if c not in seq:
        seq[c] = 1
    else:
        seq[c] = seq[c] + 1

print seq['A'],seq['C'],seq['G'],seq['T']
